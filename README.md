## Project Overview

**Entertainment Web App** is a modern web application where users can discover, search, and bookmark movies and TV series. It was developed with a **mobile-first design approach**, and the interface is kept clean and intuitive to enhance user experience.

## Application Flow

- The app consists of four main sections, each designed to display a specific type of content:

**Homepage**: Displays trending movies and recommended titles. It acts as the landing page.

**Movies**: Shows only content from the *Movies* category.

**TV Series**: Lists content specifically from the *TV Series* category.

**Bookmarked**: Displays the list of items the user has marked as favorites.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilized a component-based architecture for a modular and maintainable structure. The UI was rendered dynamically.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used modern JavaScript syntax to implement logic and interactions.

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Semantic HTML ensured structural integrity, while CSS was used to create a responsive and mobile-first design.

- **Hash-based Routing**: Implemented navigation using URL fragments (after the `#` symbol) to enable a Single Page Application (SPA) experience.

- **LocalStorage**: Used to store the user's bookmarked movies and series persistently in the browser. Data remains intact even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

- **Helper Function**: A custom routing logic (`getPage`) is defined inside the `helper.jsx` file to determine which page component to render based on the current URL. This approach eliminates the need for external routing libraries like React Router and enables a lightweight hash-based navigation system.

- **Filtering and Listing Data**: Methods like `filter`, `find`, `includes`, and `map` were used to dynamically display content based on user search input.

- **Mobile-First Design**: The design process prioritized mobile devices first, ensuring each component scales properly to larger screens as well.

- **User Notifications (Toast)**: To improve user feedback, the `react-hot-toast` library was used to show `toast.success` messages. For example, when a movie or TV show is added to or removed from bookmarks, a toast appears at the top of the screen confirming the action. This subtle feedback enhances the overall experience.

## State Management

- The application uses both global and local state management, implemented with React’s `useContext` and `useState` hooks.

> **State Management**
> 
> - *Global State (`useContext`):*  
> Used `useContext` to manage app-wide data access, such as the bookmark list. This prevents prop drilling and makes the state easily accessible across components.
> 
> - *Local State (`useState`):*  
> Used `useState` for component-specific states like search input, allowing components to manage their own local behavior independently.
